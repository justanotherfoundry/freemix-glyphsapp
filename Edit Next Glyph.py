Activates the next glyph in the tab for editing. You can give it a keyboard shortcut in the macOS system preferences.

		# note: if several glyphs are selected then this will move the whole selection.
		#       not sure whether this is useful but at least it is not an unexpected behaviour.

			# the current glyph is the very last. letâ€™s move to the very first:

			selectedLayerRange.location += 1

		# TODO: in case the new glyph is on a different line, also adjust y
